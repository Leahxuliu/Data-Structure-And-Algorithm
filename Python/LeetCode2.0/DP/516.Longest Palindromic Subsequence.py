'''
input: one word:str; the length of string is from 0 to inf;
output: int, (LSP)
corner case: the string is empty â†’ 0

Method - DP (dp[i][j]: the number of LSP, when the words from i to j)
Steps:
    1. build dp table; the table size is n * n, n is the length of word; 
    2. scan table: i is from n-1 to 0, j is from i to n -1;  the result is dp[0][n-1]
        dp[i][j] = dp[i+1][j-1] + 2, when word[i] == word[j]
                  = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i][j -1]), when word[i] != word[j]
        base case:
            dp[i][j] = 1, i == j
Time Complexity: O(N**2)
Space Complexity: O(N**2)
